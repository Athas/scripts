# Simplistic session management for `surf`.
#
# Only URLs are remembered, no cookie, HTTP session, or browsing
# history is stored.  The script is supposed to be called
# automatically by `surf` to update URL data, and by user commands to
# resume them.  File locking via `flock` is used to ensure atomicity
# of modifications to the sessions file.
#
# An URL is considered an "orphan" if its listed PID no longer
# refers to a live process.
#
# The first argument to `surfsession` indicates the action to be
# taken, with the following actions being supported:
#
# * `add` _pid_ _url_ _title_: store _url_, with the given _title_,
# as being browsed by the process `_pid_`.
#
# * `remove` _pid_ _url_: remove any _url_ being browsed by _pid_.
#
# * `purge` _url_: remove any _url_ being browsed by any process.
#
# * `restore`: start `surf` for all orphan URLs.
#
# * `resume`: use `sinmenu` to select an orphan URL, which will be
#   opened in `surf`.
